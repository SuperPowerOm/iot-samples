# Samples
Sample code for Particle Argon Projects

## Objective
The main objective of this repo is to help students and mentors with some sample and working particle code at one place.

## Scope
The scope of the samples will be limited to sensor and data processing code to get you started with some basics.
You can always search for particle code samples on the web. The only advantage of these samples are that these have been tested on the Argon chipset and sensor versions in use in this hackathon.

### Sample Code

temp-hum-logger - 
This code collects temperature and humidity data from the sensor and logs it on adafruit.io.

Tt also checks for a condition of humidity too-high. This event is then used by IFTTT to send a notification SMS text.

# Samples
Sample code for Argon Projects

## Objective
The main objective of this repo is to help students and mentors with some sample code at one place.

## Scope
The scope of the samples will be limited to sensor and data processing code to get you started with some basics.
You can always search for particle code samples on the web. The only advantage of these samples are that these have been tested on the Argon chipset and sensor versions in use in this hackathon.
